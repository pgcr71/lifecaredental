        "description": "Cosmetic dentistry services are increasing in popularity and, as a result, provide a great opportunity for dental practices to grow their customer base. One of the most common cosmetic dentistry procedures is teeth whitening or “teeth bleaching” which is sought by people looking to brighten their smile and reduce the appearance of stains or discoloration. Examples of other common cosmetic dentistry procedures include dental implants, dental crowns, teeth shaping, tooth bonding.

        "description": "Endodontic procedures refer to painless root canal therapy. Typically, when the interior of a patient’s tooth becomes infected, damaged, or diseased, general dentists will refer them to an endodontist. The endodontist will then be able to diagnose and treat the issues with the tooth’s sensitive interior, performing root canals when necessary. By offering such specialized endodontic procedures at your own practice, however, you can avoid outsourcing such services and expand your customer base.",
